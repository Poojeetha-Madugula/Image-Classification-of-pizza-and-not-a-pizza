# Image-Classification-of-pizza-and-not-a-pizza

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to classify images into two categories: pizza and not pizza. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Residual Nets, we aim to compare the performance of these deep learning architectures in accurately distinguishing between pizza and non-pizza images.

## Conclusion:
After extensive experimentation and evaluation, it was found that both CNN and Residual Nets performed well in classifying pizza images. However, Residual Nets demonstrated a slightly higher accuracy compared to CNN. This suggests that Residual Nets, with its improved ability to handle the vanishing gradient problem, may be more suitable for this image classification task. Further optimization and fine-tuning of the models could potentially enhance accuracy and provide deeper insights into the discriminative features between pizza and non-pizza images.
